## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I discovered how to position elements on top of others using margins. It's fascinating â€“ not only can you create space between elements, but you can also precisely position an element over others. For instance, I utilized this technique to center the profile picture perfectly within the profile card.


```css

.profile img {
    height: 100px;
    margin-top: -55px;
    border-radius:  100px;
    padding: 5px;
    background: white;
}
```
